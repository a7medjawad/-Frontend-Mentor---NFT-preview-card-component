## My process

> I started with the NFT preview card component structure in html, then I started with the tailwinds CSS styles, putting the card in the center of the main block using flexbox, grid system, added colors and smooth borders making it look like the design finally with doing some hover on some items and applying hover on image using relative and absolute attributes and controlling design to be responsive on mobile.
